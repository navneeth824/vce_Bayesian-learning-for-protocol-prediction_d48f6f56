# Bayesian learning for protocol prediction

The code predicts protocol category of given cells. 66 cells were only used due to insufficient datasets with protocol description. Therefore maximum accuracy for SVM is 67%. This decreases the accuracy of overall model too. Next step to increase accuracy would be to increase protocol dataset.
